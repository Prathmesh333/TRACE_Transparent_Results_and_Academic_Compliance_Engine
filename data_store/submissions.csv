s1,a1,s-SCIS-1-0,Aarav Sharma,23SCIS100,CS501,"Bubble Sort Analysis: Time Complexity O(n^2) in worst case. Space Complexity O(1). Quick Sort has better average performance with O(n log n) time complexity. Merge Sort guarantees O(n log n) but requires O(n) extra space.",bubble_sort_analysis.txt,2024-01-26,85,"Good analysis of time complexity. Clear explanation of space complexity trade-offs.","Student demonstrated solid understanding of algorithm complexity. Correctly identified time and space complexities for multiple sorting algorithms. Could improve by adding more detailed examples and edge cases.",false,0,,pending_review
s2,a1,s-SCIS-1-2,Rohan Kumar,23SCIS102,CS501,"Sorting algorithms are important. Bubble sort is slow. Quick sort is fast.",sorting_basics.txt,2024-01-26,45,"Analysis lacks depth. Missing complexity notation and detailed explanations.","Student provided only surface-level understanding. Missing Big-O notation, no mathematical analysis, and insufficient comparison between algorithms. Needs significant improvement in technical depth.",false,0,,pending_review
s3,a2,s-SCIS-2-0,Akash Pillai,22SCIS200,CS601,"Implemented a 3-layer neural network with backpropagation. Used sigmoid activation function. Training accuracy: 92%. Test accuracy: 88%. Implemented gradient descent optimization.",neural_net_impl.py,2024-01-26,92,"Excellent implementation with proper backpropagation. Good accuracy results and clear documentation.","Outstanding work. Student implemented all required components including forward pass, backpropagation, and optimization. Code is well-structured and documented. Results demonstrate proper understanding of neural network fundamentals.",false,0,,pending_review
s4,a3,s-SCIS-1-10,Aditya Joshi,23SCIS110,IT502,"Design patterns are reusable solutions. Singleton ensures one instance. Factory creates objects. Observer notifies changes.",design_patterns_brief.txt,2024-01-26,60,"Basic coverage of patterns but lacks implementation examples and use cases.","Student identified key design patterns but explanation is too brief. Missing code examples, UML diagrams, and real-world use cases. Report needs more depth and practical demonstrations.",false,0,,pending_review
s5,a1,s-SCIS-1-1,Priya Patel,23SCIS101,CS501,"Comprehensive analysis of sorting algorithms including Bubble Sort O(n^2), Quick Sort O(n log n) average, Merge Sort O(n log n) guaranteed, Heap Sort O(n log n). Detailed comparison of space complexity: Bubble Sort O(1), Quick Sort O(log n), Merge Sort O(n), Heap Sort O(1). Included performance benchmarks and use case recommendations.",algorithm_analysis_complete.txt,2024-01-26,95,"Exceptional analysis with comprehensive coverage. Excellent use of Big-O notation and practical examples.","Exemplary work. Student provided thorough analysis of multiple algorithms with correct complexity calculations. Included performance benchmarks and practical recommendations. Demonstrates advanced understanding of algorithmic analysis.",true,98,"Outstanding work! Added 3 bonus points for the performance benchmarks.",approved
